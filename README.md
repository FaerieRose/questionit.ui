# Questionit User Interface (FrontEnd)

This is the FrontEnd of an exam application for ProgramIT (http://www.programit.nl/). The intention was that the trainers created questions in the app to better prepare students for their exam. The project was abandoned before it was completed.

The application was divided in a BackEnd and FrontEnd. The latter can be found in another repository: https://github.com/FaerieRose/questionit

## FaerieRose Comment

I was mainly involved during the start of this project. First I created the base structure for Angular-Cli. I set up the initial layout of the webpages using Bootstrap (http://getbootstrap.com/ )and CSS. Next, I set up the base for future routing. Colleagues of mine continued on the project while I started preparing my classes.

## Angular-Cli

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.19-3.

To get more help on the `angular-cli` use `ng --help` or go check out the [Angular-CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
